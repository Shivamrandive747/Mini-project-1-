Mini project 1 - Description 
Conducted an in-depth literature survey on the application of machine learning in materials science, focusing on how ML techniques are used for property prediction and materials discovery. Gained hands-on understanding of core machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, along with their mathematical foundations—covering concepts like loss functions, gradient descent, model evaluation, and overfitting. This project laid the groundwork for applying ML methods in my later research projects.
