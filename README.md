📌 Mini Project 1: Literature Survey on Machine Learning in Materials Science
Conducted an in-depth literature review on the application of machine learning in materials discovery and property prediction.

Studied supervised learning models including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.

Learned the mathematical foundations of ML models: loss functions, optimization (e.g., gradient descent), and model evaluation techniques.

Built foundational understanding of applying ML techniques to real-world problems in materials science.

📌 Mini Project 2: Machine Learning Applications in Energy Materials
A. Perovskite Formability Prediction

Used supervised learning to classify ABO₃ compounds based on formability.

Employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) with feature engineering (ionic radii, electronegativity, tolerance factor, octahedral factor).

Achieved ~95% classification accuracy with zero false negatives.

B. Lattice Constant Prediction for Half-Heusler Alloys

Reproduced a published Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model.

Used atomic descriptors (e.g., ionic radii, electronegativity) to predict the lattice constant
